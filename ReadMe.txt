This repository contains code aimed at two primary objectives:

(1) Generate simulated data mimicking live fluorescent microscopy data of transcritpional activity

(2) USe simulated data as foundation for developing ML segmentation algorithms capable of robustly differentiating active transcription loci from noisy background
